I am a Software Engineering PhD Candidate at University of California Irvine, with strong research and software development skills, extensive experience in managing cross-functional teams, and producing deliverables. My research focuses on enhancing the process of Software Engineering for Accelerated Computing, Quantum-Classical Hybrid Computing, High-Performance Computing. 
Having worked as project manager for 400+ undergraduate and graduate students in collaboration with both start-ups and large companieshave, I have extensive experience in delivering software products and research deliverables, teaching essential software engineering best practices. 
My published work includes formulation and benchmarks of the Sub-graph isomorphism problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, as a QUBO model, amenable to adiabatic quantum annealing computers, to address software engineering problems. 

Currently, I am on track to graduate from the PhD program in 2026, and I intend to join industry upon graduating.
I am an international student from India currently on an F-1 visa.

I am a researcher and also work as a consultant for software engineering and research projects in the Quantum Computing and High Performance Computing spaces.
